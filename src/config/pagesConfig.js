We're super excited to be hosting at our cozy venue, De Sering once again for another special night.   This time around as well as a long overdue b2b from NPP hosts (Baretaire and Pseudo) we have our good friend Neo coming to scrape wax with two technics and a bag full of records with a tight selection of fine driving prog house. We've had combining a night with Neo in the works for a very long time and finally the stars aligned!  We can't wait to see you there - hope you can make it, Henri & Joel x",
